Hi! I am an undergraduate in my final year studying Computer Science, Systems Science & Engineering, and History at Washington University in St. Louis. Currently, I am working with [Prof. Michael Brent](https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Michael-Brent.html), [Woo Seok Jung](https://jungwooseok.com/), and [Sandeep Acharya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeep-acharya-83abb1b7/?originalSubdomain=np) on mapping transcriptional regulatory networks using ensemble machine learning.

I am interested in using machine learning, visualization, and network science to study pressing issues. So far, my research has focused on biology and public health. Recent coursework has increased my excitement about other applications in the humanities and social sciences. I am a huge proponent of interdisciplinary work - please reach out if you would like to collaborate!
