Hi! I am an undergraduate in my final year studying Computer Science, Systems Science & Engineering, and History at Washington University in St. Louis. Currently, I am working with [Professor Michael Brent](https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Michael-Brent.html), [Woo Seok Jung](https://jungwooseok.com/), and [Sandeep Acharya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeep-acharya-83abb1b7/?originalSubdomain=np) on mapping transcriptional regulatory networks using ensemble machine learning.

This fall, I will be heading to College Park to pursue a PhD in Information Studies at the University of Maryland. Through collaborations within this interdisciplinary program, I will explore how data and computing can play a role in addressing today's hardest social and technical problems. I look forward to getting started!
