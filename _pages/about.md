I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Information Studies at the University of Maryland, advised by [Prof. Zubin Jelveh](https://zjelveh.github.io/). Currently, my research interests include data science, machine learning, network analysis, and digital history. 

I have a B.S. in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis, with a second major in Systems Science & Engineering and a minor in History. At WashU, I conducted research on applications of machine learning and network analysis to biology with [Prof. Michael Brent](https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Michael-Brent.html).
