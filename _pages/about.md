I am an incoming PhD student in Information Studies at the University of Maryland. In Spring 2025, I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with a B.S. in Computer Science, a second major in Systems Science & Engineering, and a minor in History. Currently, my research interests include data science (network analysis, visualization, machine learning, GIS), computational social science, and digital history. 

In the past, my research centered on applications of data science in biology and public health, including mapping biological networks in humans and analyzing predictors of opioid prescribing in the emergency department. Through history courses and project-based courses at the intersection of data science and the social sciences, I became interested in how data science tools can help us better understand the past and present, and how data science practices can be informed by theory from the humanities and social sciences. 

My broad interests across data science, the humanities, and the social sciences have led me to the interdisciplinary field of information studies.
