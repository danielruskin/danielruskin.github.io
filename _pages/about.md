I am a first-year PhD student in Information Studies at the University of Maryland, advised by [Prof. Zubin Jelveh](https://zjelveh.github.io/). Currently, my research interests include data science (machine learning, network analysis, visualization, GIS) and digital history. 

I have a B.S. in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis, with a second major in Systems Science & Engineering and a minor in History. My broad interests across data science, the humanities, and the social sciences have led me to the interdisciplinary field of Information Studies.
